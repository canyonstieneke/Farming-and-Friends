# Farming-and-Friends
This is a server-client program meant to be an open source rival to FSN (Farm Simulator Network)
This will have a banking system, invoices, asset/equipment tracking, server tracking, among other features that FSN has, but without all the meta stuff, we will be focusing mainly on in game play.
