# Farming-and-Friends
This is a server-client program meant to be an open source rival to FSN (Farm Simulator Network)
This will have a banking system, invoices, asset/equipment tracking, server tracking, among other features that FSN has, but without all the meta stuff, we will be focusing mainly on in game play.

This is currently a work in progress, and if any C99 Devs who play farmsim wanna help, I am looking for help, and I will admit that I am a novice programer.

Our discord is here if you wanna join the project. https://discord.gg/PY9snAxzYd
